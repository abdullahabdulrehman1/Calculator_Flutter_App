UPDATED THIS
If you spot a problem with the docs, search if an issue already exists. If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant issue form.

Solve an issue
Scan through our existing issues to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using labels as filters. See Labels for more information. As a general rule, we don’t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.
